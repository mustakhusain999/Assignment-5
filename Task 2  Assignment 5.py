# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Step1: Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# Step2: Extracting the first five elements from the list
extracted = numbers[0:5]

# Step3: Displaying the original list, the extracted elements, and the reversed extracted elements.
print(f"Original list:{numbers}")
print(f"Extracted first five elements: {numbers[0:5]}")
print(f"Reversed extracted elements: {extracted}")
# print(f"Reversed extracted elements: {numbers[4::-1]}")
